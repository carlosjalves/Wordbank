# Children's Vocabulary Development Data Visualization

We were challenged to create a visualization that enabled the user to explore and analyze the information we chose to represent which was, in our case, the relation between the number of words learned how to produce (through voicing) by kids between 16 and 36 months and the caregiver education per language.
